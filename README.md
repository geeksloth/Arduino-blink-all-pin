# Arduino-blink-all-pin
Blink all pins at once (for testing purpose).

To test the functionality of the Arduino board pinouts, I developed a set of basic sketches for models like the Uno and Mega 2560. Despite extensive searches for a straightforward solution, no existing method proved effective. These scripts are intended to provide a simple way to verify pin operability. Additional sketches for other models will follow as time permits. This approach may prove useful for others as well.
